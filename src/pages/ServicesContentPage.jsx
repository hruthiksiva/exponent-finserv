              <p>
                A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan that allows you to borrow funds from a bank or financial institution
                for personal expenses like medical emergencies, weddings, home renovations, or travel. No collateral is required
                for a personal loan, and the repayment is usually in monthly installments (EMIs).
              </p>
